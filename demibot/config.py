    These connection settings will be used by demibot if started without a
    <server> argument.

    Currently, NickServ and server passwords are read from an "auth" file in
    either the root directory of demibot or ~/.demibot or ~/.config/demibot.
    Alternatively, you obviously can just enter the passwords here in plaintext.
    Other than that, the file should be self-explanatory.

    Sets for admins and channels. Everything else is a dict.

    The auth file has a very simple syntax of identifier passphrase, e.g.:
    user nickservpassword
    server serverpassword
