"""demibot config.py

    This file will be used by demibot if started without command-line arguments.
    Make sure you configure it to your liking.
    Currently, NickServ and server passwords are read from a .auth file in the
    root directory of demibot. This will probably change. Alternatively, you
    obviously can just enter the passwords here in plaintext.
    Other than that, the file should be self-explanatory.
    Tuple for superadmins, sets for admins and channels. Everything else
    is a dict.
